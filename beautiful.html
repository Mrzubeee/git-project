            <span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Known For:</span> Colourfull Bridge<br>
            The Rainbow Bridge in China, also known as the Nanpu Bridge, is a significant architectural landmark located in Shanghai. It spans across the Huangpu River, connecting the bustling Pudong and Puxi districts of the city. While the Rainbow Bridge is not directly associated with Zaha Hadid, it is an iconic structure that has contributed to the city's skyline and transportation infrastructure.

The Nanpu Bridge is notable for its distinctive spiral ramps at each end, which allow vehicles to smoothly transition between the bridge deck and the ground level. These ramps give the bridge its unique appearance, resembling a coil or a spiral, hence the nickname "Rainbow Bridge." The design of the bridge allows for efficient traffic flow, easing congestion in one of China's most populous cities.

Completed in 1991, the Nanpu Bridge was one of the first cable-stayed bridges in China and played a crucial role in the development of Shanghai's infrastructure. Its construction marked a significant milestone in the city's urbanization and economic growth, providing a vital link between its eastern and western banks.

            <span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Known For:</span>The longest continuous bridge over water in the world<br>
            The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is one of the most remarkable feats of engineering in the United States, specifically located in southern Louisiana. It is a long bridge system that spans Lake Pontchartrain, connecting the southern shore of the lake near Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans, to Mandeville and the northern shore of the lake.

The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway consists of two parallel bridges: the northbound bridge, which was completed in 1956, and the southbound bridge, which was completed in 1969. Both bridges are long and straight, with the southbound bridge slightly longer than the northbound one. At the time of their construction, each bridge held the record for the longest continuous bridge over water in the world.

The total length of the Causeway system, which includes both bridges and the approach spans, is approximately 38.35 kilometers (23.83 miles). The southbound bridge measures about 23.87 kilometers (14.83 miles) long, while the northbound bridge is slightly shorter, at approximately 23.83 kilometers (14.81 miles) in length. This makes the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway the longest continuous bridge over water in the world by total length.

            The Golden Bridge in Vietnam, also known as Cau Vang in Vietnamese, is a spectacular pedestrian bridge located in the Ba Na Hills near the city of Da Nang. This iconic bridge has gained international fame for its unique design and stunning views of the surrounding landscape.

The Golden Bridge stands at an altitude of approximately 1,400 meters (4,600 feet) above sea level and stretches for about 150 meters (490 feet) across the lush greenery of the Ba Na Hills. What sets this bridge apart is its striking appearance. It is supported by two massive stone hands that appear to emerge from the mountainside, giving the illusion that the bridge is being held up by giant hands.

These hands are weathered and aged, giving them a realistic appearance, and are adorned with a golden hue, hence the name "Golden Bridge." The pedestrian walkway itself is made of steel mesh and lined with yellow-colored railing, adding to the bridge's golden aesthetic.

The Golden Bridge not only provides visitors with an unforgettable photo opportunity but also offers panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, including the distant mountains and forests. On clear days, visitors can even catch a glimpse of the shimmering coastline in the distance.
