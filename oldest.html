The Alcántara Bridge is an ancient Roman bridge located in Spain, crossing the Tagus River in the province of Cáceres, Extremadura region. It is one of the most significant Roman engineering feats in the Iberian Peninsula and stands as a testament to the ingenuity and durability of Roman construction.

The bridge was built during the reign of Emperor Trajan in the early 2nd century AD, between 104 and 106 AD, to facilitate military campaigns and trade routes across the Iberian Peninsula. It was constructed using massive stone blocks and features six arches, with the central arch being the largest and tallest, reaching a height of approximately 45 meters (148 feet).

The Alcántara Bridge is approximately 194 meters (636 feet) long and 8 meters (26 feet) wide, making it a substantial structure that has withstood the test of time. It was built using a technique called "opus quadratum," in which large, precisely cut stone blocks were fitted together without the use of mortar, ensuring the bridge's stability and longevity.

Throughout its history, the Alcántara Bridge has served as a vital transportation link, connecting the northern and southern regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It has also played a strategic role in various military conflicts and has been a symbol of Roman engineering prowess.

            The Chapel Bridge, known as Kapellbrücke in German, is a famous landmark located in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. It is one of the most iconic and recognizable structures in Switzerland, renowned for its historical significance and distinctive design.

            The Chapel Bridge spans across the Reuss River, connecting the old town of Lucerne with the newer part of the city. It is characterized by its wooden structure, covered walkway, and triangular roof adorned with paintings depicting scenes from Swiss history and mythology.
            
            Originally built in the 14th century as part of the city's fortifications, the Chapel Bridge served as both a defensive structure and a crossing for pedestrians. It also housed a small chapel, from which it derives its name.
            
            The Chapel Bridge has undergone several renovations and reconstructions over the centuries, including restoration efforts following a fire in 1993 that damaged a significant portion of the bridge. Despite this, much of its original structure and historical charm have been preserved, making it a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Lucerne's heritage.

            The Ponte Sant'Angelo, also known as the Bridge of Angels, is a famous bridge in Rome, Italy. It spans the Tiber River and connects the city center with the Castel Sant'Angelo, a historic fortress originally built as a mausoleum for Emperor Hadrian.

The construction of the Ponte Sant'Angelo began in 134 AD under the reign of Emperor Hadrian, who commissioned the bridge to provide a direct link between the city center and his mausoleum. The bridge was originally named Pons Aelius, after Hadrian's family name. It consisted of three central arches made of stone, with two smaller arches on either end.

Throughout its history, the bridge has undergone several renovations and reconstructions due to damage caused by floods and other factors. One significant renovation occurred during the Renaissance period when Pope Clement VII commissioned the renowned Italian architect and painter Gian Lorenzo Bernini to redesign the bridge.

Bernini's renovation of the Ponte Sant'Angelo took place in the 17th century. He added ten angel statues to the bridge, each holding symbols of the Passion of Christ. These marble statues were created by Bernini's students and other notable sculptors of the time, including his own son.

The Ponte di Tiberio, also known as the Bridge of Tiberius, is a Roman bridge located in Rimini, Italy. It spans the Marecchia River and is one of the city's most significant historical landmarks.

The Ponte di Tiberio was constructed during the reign of Emperor Augustus, between 14 AD and 21 AD, but it was completed and dedicated by Emperor Tiberius in 21 AD, hence its name. The bridge was a vital component of the Via Flaminia, an ancient Roman road that connected Rome to the city of Rimini and eventually extended to the northern regions of Italy.

The bridge is constructed from Istrian stone and features five semicircular arches supported by massive pillars. Originally, it was around 70 meters long, but over the centuries, modifications and reconstructions have altered its dimensions. Despite its age, the Ponte di Tiberio has withstood the test of time and remains in use for pedestrian and vehicular traffic, making it one of the oldest functioning bridges in Italy.

            The Pons Aemilius, also known as the Ponte Emilio or Ponte Rotto (Broken Bridge), is an ancient Roman bridge located in Rome, Italy. It spanned the Tiber River and was one of the earliest bridges constructed in ancient Rome.

The exact period of construction for the Pons Aemilius is not precisely known, but it is believed to have been built around 179 BC by the Roman censor Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Hence, it was named after him.

The bridge originally had stone piers and wooden arches, making it an impressive engineering feat for its time. However, due to the Tiber's unpredictable floods and the passage of time, much of the original structure has been destroyed.

Today, only a few ruins of the Pons Aemilius remain visible near the modern Ponte Rotto (Broken Bridge), which is a later reconstruction. Despite its partial destruction, the Pons Aemilius holds historical significance as one of the earliest examples of Roman bridge-building technology and infrastructure.
